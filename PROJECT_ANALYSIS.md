## 4. Code Quality and Best Practices Analysis

The project demonstrates a good understanding of modern web development practices. The code is generally well-organized, readable, and makes good use of TypeScript's features.

**Strengths:**

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The code is well-structured into reusable components.
*   **State Management:** The use of React Context for managing global state (theme, language) is appropriate for the size of the application.
*   **Accessibility:** The project shows a strong commitment to accessibility, with the use of semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and features like `prefers-reduced-motion`.
*   **Code Style:** The use of ESLint and Prettier ensures a consistent code style.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Component Cohesion:** Some components, like `Header.tsx`, have a lot of responsibilities and could be broken down into smaller, more focused components.
*   **i18n:** The translation mechanism is basic. A more feature-rich library like `i18next` would provide better support for pluralization and interpolation.
*   **Error Handling:** The `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component could be enhanced to log errors to a remote service for better monitoring and debugging.

## 5. Identified Issues and Potential Improvements

### High Priority

*   **Confusing ESLint Configuration:** The project has a legacy `.eslintrc.cjs` file. This should be removed in favor of a modern `eslint.config.js` file.
*   **Complex TypeScript Configuration:** The presence of three `tsconfig.json` files is confusing. The configuration should be simplified, ideally into a single `tsconfig.json` file.
*   **Outdated Dependencies and Vulnerabilities:** The `package.json` file shows several outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities. These should be updated to their latest versions, and `npm audit fix` should be run to patch the vulnerabilities.

### Medium Priority

*   **Refactor Large Components:** Components like `Header.tsx` and `pdfGenerator.ts` should be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
*   **Add Unit Tests:** The project lacks tests. Adding unit tests with a framework like Vitest and React Testing Library would significantly improve code quality and prevent regressions.

### Low Priority

*   **Improve Code Splitting:** While the project uses `manualChunks` for code splitting, it could be further improved by using dynamic imports for the portfolio sections to load them on demand.

## 6. Suggestions for New Features

*   **Contact Form:** Add a contact form to allow users to send messages directly from the website.
*   **Blog:** Add a blog section to share articles and tutorials.
*   **CMS Integration:** Integrate the project with a headless CMS like Strapi or Contentful to make the content easier to manage.
